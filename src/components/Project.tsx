                <p>TicketingHuat is a secure, feature-rich platform I developed for distributing and managing tickets to events such as concerts and conventions. 
                    To handle high-demand scenarios, it incorporates a virtual queue system and automatic seat assignment, ensuring fair access and real-time updates during peak times. The platform integrates seamlessly with Stripe for secure payment processing, safeguarding user transactions. It also allows authenticated users to transfer tickets within the system, maintaining authenticity and preventing fraud. Administrators benefit from a dedicated dashboard to create, edit, and monitor events and manage user accounts. Emphasizing robust security measures, TicketingHuat includes multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and secure session management, providing a safe and seamless experience for both users and event organizers. The development process leveraged a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, automating testing, building, and deployment processes. This ensured consistent quality, with integrated OWASP Dependency Checks and SonarQube scans identifying and resolving vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle. 
                    By streamlining deployments and maintaining high standards of security and performance, Jenkins played a pivotal role in the project’s success.</p>
